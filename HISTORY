fastqcheck was original written by Richard Durbin around 1993/2006.

Further development was carried out by staff at the Sanger
Institute when it became part of a private 'fastqtools' SVN
repository in 2009.

This git repository was created in 2013 by Sendu Bala in the
Vertebrate Resequencing (VR) group at the Sanger for the purpose
of making the code publicly available. It carries the history from
the SVN repository. The SVN version, tagged 'v1', incorporates
changes that Petr Danecek (VR) made during the 1000 genomes
project, in addition to some other changes that VR did not use
for that project. The outputs of fastqcheck are different
between v1 and what VR used, which is tagged as v1b.

v1 is probably "better" than v1b, but is untested by those of
us in VR. Since the public release is intended to help people
duplicate what we did for the 1000 genomes project, v1b is the
default, at the HEAD of the master branch.
