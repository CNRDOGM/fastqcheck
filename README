fastqcheck is a program that reads fastq files (sequencing data:
http://maq.sourceforge.net/fastq.shtml).

It generates statistics about the files (for example, how many reads and bases
there were).

It can be used as a validator of fastq files (though is perhaps stricter that
the spec).


Usage:
$ fastqcheck lane1.fastq > lane1.fastq.fastqcheck
$ gunzip -c lane1.fastq.gz | fastqcheck > lan1.fastq.gz.fastqcheck

The software is built and installed in the standard manner using configure and make.
Installation instructions are in the INSTALL file.
